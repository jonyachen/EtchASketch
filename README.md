Code for ECE 4760: Design with Microcontrollers project

- Designed, constructed, and tested a glove-operated system that dynamically simulates the classic toy, Etch A Sketch, on a TFT LCD screen
- Achieves a user-friendly, low-cost simulation, programmed onto a PIC32 microcontroller unit
- Used spectra flex sensors, a MPU-6050 gyroscope/accelerometer, and I2C communication protocol
